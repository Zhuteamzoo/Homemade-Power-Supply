# Homemade Bench Power Supply (PC PSU Conversion)

## Overview
This project involved converting an old PC power supply into a usable bench power supply with an on/off switch and accessible 12V and 5V outputs. I built it as a practical way to power my electronics projects without purchasing a commercial power supply.

## Goal
I wanted a reliable power source that I could turn on and off easily and use to power different components, such as motors, sensors, and microcontrollers.

## What I started with
I used a power supply extracted from an old desktop computer. These power supplies already provide regulated voltage rails, but they are not designed for direct use in small projects.

## Key modifications
- Added an external **on/off switch** to control the power supply  
- Exposed **12V and 5V outputs** for easy access  
- Organized the wiring so the outputs could be reused across projects  

All of the components were housed inside a shoebox, which acted as a simple enclosure.

## Challenges
One challenge was managing many wires that were not originally meant to be user-facing. I had to identify the correct voltage rails and make sure connections were secure enough to be used safely.

## Result
The converted power supply worked reliably and became a reusable tool for my other projects. It allowed me to power devices without relying on batteries or buying a dedicated bench supply.

## What I learned
This project taught me that if I don’t have access to a tool I need, I can often build one myself. It also helped me understand power distribution and why stable voltage is important for electronics projects.
